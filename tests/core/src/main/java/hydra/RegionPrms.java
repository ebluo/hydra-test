/**
 * A class used to store keys for region configuration settings.
 * The settings are used to create instances of {@link RegionDescription}.
 * <p>
 * The number of description instances is gated by {@link #names}.  For other
 * parameters, if fewer values than names are given, the remaining instances
 * will use the last value in the list.  See $JTESTS/hydra/hydra.txt for more
 * details.
 * <p>
 * Unused parameters default to null, except where noted.  This uses the
 * product default, except where noted.
 * <p>
 * Values, fields, and subfields of a parameter can be set to {@link #DEFAULT},
 * except where noted.  This uses the product default, except where noted.
 * <p>
 * Values, fields, and subfields can be set to {@link #NONE} where noted, with
 * the documented effect.
 * <p>
 * Values, fields, and subfields of a parameter can use oneof, range, or robing
 * except where noted, but each description created will use a fixed value
 * chosen at test configuration time.  Use as a task attribute is illegal.
 * <p>
 * Subfields are order-dependent, as stated in the javadocs for parameters that
 * use them.
