/**
 * <p>
 * This class provides a public API that hydra clients can use to dynamically
 * reboot hosts during a test run. The API can only be used for hosts that are
 * virtual machines, and only virtual machines running on Unix platforms.
 * Using reboot on a Window hosts requires the {@link Bootstrapper} to be
 * installed as a Windows service with the proper user name, using the build
 * under test.
 * <p>
 * The API is also restricted to hydra tasks of type "TASK". Only hosts used by
 * hydra client JVMs and/or hydra-managed Hadoop processes are available for
 * reboot. The source of a reboot, and other test processes, can be running on
 * the same host as the virtual machine being rebooted and are unaffected by
 * the reboot.
 * <p>
 * A host is not available to be rebooted if:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the host is not a virtual machine running on a Unix platform
 *   <li>the hydra master is running on the host
 *   <li>the source of the reboot is running on the host (a client cannot
 *       reboot its own host)</li>
 *   <li>the host is already the target of a reboot</li>
 *   <li>any client on the host is the source or target of a dynamic action
 *       via the {@link ClientVmMgr} API</li>
 *   <li>the RebootInfo for the host from a previous reboot has not been
 *       cleared using {@link #clearInfo}</li>
 * </ul>
 * A {@link RebootHostNotFoundException} is thrown if a host is not available
 * to be used as a target.
 * <p>
 * Methods are available in synchronous versions only. They do not return until
 * the host has rebooted and the hydra hostagent has been restarted on the host.
 * <p>
 * The reboot API returns the information needed to restart hydra client and
 * Hadoop processes on a host after it is rebooted. This information is
 * returned in a {@link RebootInfo} object, and is also available to any hydra
 * client after a reboot through the {@link #getInfo} method.
 * <p>
 * The test must ensure that no Hadoop processes are being stopped or started
 * during a reboot. Hydra does not enforce this, but assumes that all processes
 * in a Hadoop cluster have been started at least once prior to any reboot.
 * The test must also take care not to invoke any other methods that require
 * the hostagent on the host being rebooted.
 * <p>
 * The reboot method can optionally return only processes that were live at the
 * time of the reboot or include those that were previously stopped using the
 * {@link ClientVmMgr} and/or {@link HadoopHelper} APIs.
 * <p>
 * It is the responsibility of the test to use the {@link ClientVmMgr} and
 * {@link HadoopHelper} APIs to restart the desired processes after reboot
 * using the information contained in the RebootInfo object. The test must then
 * use {@link #clearInfo} to make the host available for another reboot.
 * <p>
 * The RebootInfo does not include processes started by hydra clients through
 * {@link ProcessMgr#bgexec} or {@link ProcessMgr#fgexec} methods, {@link Java
 * #java}, {@link HadoopHelper#runHadoopCommand}, or {@link CacheServerHelper}.
 * If processes started through these methods are running at the time of a
 * reboot, it is up to the test to manage the outcome, such as updating
 * nukerun scripts, and to optionally restart the processes using information
 * the test has saved.
 * <p>
 * Reboot is equivalent to pulling the plug on a host. As a result, the log
 * files for processes running on the host will not show messages that were
 * buffered at the time of the reboot. The product logger does a flush on each
 * write, but messages are still logged by the operating system, disk subsystem,
 * and physical disk. NFS also buffers, so message loss can be reduced by
 * running processes with user directories local to the host being rebooted.
 * <p>
 * Dynamic actions are carried out in the master, using threads named for the
 * source client and the action, e.g., <code>Dynamic Rebooter</code>. To see
 * the steps in a reboot, look for messages from this thread in the hydra
 * taskmaster log.
