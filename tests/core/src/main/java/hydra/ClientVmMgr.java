/**
 *  <p>
 *  This class provides a public API that hydra clients can use to dynamically
 *  stop or start client VMs during a test run.  The API can only be used from
 *  hydra tasks of type "TASK".
 *  <p>
 *  Hydra clients can stop any client VM, including their own.  They can only
 *  start client VMs other than themselves, for obvious reasons.  A VM can only
 *  be the target of a dynamic action by one client at a time.  A VM cannot be
 *  the target of a dynamic action while it is itself (briefly) engaged as a
 *  source initiating an action on another VM.  However, once a dynamic action
 *  has been initiated, the source of the action becomes available as a target
 *  while the action is taking place (unless it is also the target).
 *  <p>
 *  Stop and start methods are available in synchronous and asynchronous
 *  versions.  Asynchronous methods return as soon as the stop or start is
 *  initiated, and allow clients to stop themselves and stop or start others
 *  while they are doing real work.  Synchronous methods do not return until the
 *  requested stop or start has fully completed.  They should be used with
 *  caution for reasons described later.
 *  <p>
 *  A {@link ClientVmInfo} object can be passed in to some methods to describe
 *  the target VM using various combinations of parameters.  If more than one
 *  VM matches the target info, the implementation chooses one to be acted upon.
 *  The methods throw {@link ClientVmNotFoundException} if no VMs matching the
 *  target info are available as a target, either because they are already
 *  the targets of dynamic actions or are initiating dynamic actions themselves.
 *  <p>
 *  How a VM is stopped is controlled by the <b>stop mode</b>, which is one of
 *  {@link #MEAN_KILL}, {@link #NICE_KILL}, {@link #MEAN_EXIT}, {@link
 *  #NICE_EXIT}, or {@link #NICE_DISCONNECT}.  When a VM is actually stopped
 *  depends on 1) the stop
 *  mode and 2) whether it contains clients that have been configured for
 *  CLOSETASKs that have the <code>runMode</code> set to <code>always</code> or
 *  <code>dynamic</code>.  To prevent a CLOSETASK from running on dynamic exits,
 *  use run mode <code>once</code>, which is the default setting.
 *  <p>
 *  How and when a VM is restarted is controlled by the <b>start mode</b>, which
 *  is one of {@link #IMMEDIATE}, {@link #ON_DEMAND}, {@link #NEVER}, or
 *  after a specified number of milliseconds.  When the VM is actually scheduled
 *  to run TASKs again depends on 1) the start mode and 2) whether it contains
 *  clients that have been configured for INITTASKs that have the
 *  <code>run mode</code> set to <code>always</code> or <code>dynamic</code>.
 *  To prevent an INITTASK from running on dynamic starts, use run mode
 *  <code>once</code>, which is the default setting.
 *  <p>
 *  Synchronous methods using an exit stop mode can experience a large delay if
 *  clients in the target VM must complete their current TASKs.  The delay is
 *  even greater if they must complete some number of CLOSETASKs on shutdown or
 *  INITTASKs on startup.  Also, synchronization can cause deadlock, and it is
 *  up to the test developer to avoid it.  For example, if two VMs attempt to
 *  stop each other at the same time, they will block if circumstances require
 *  them both to complete their current task.
 *  <p>
 *  When a VM is dynamically started, it creates a new log file using the same
 *  logical VM ID but a new PID.  Client logs contain informational messages
 *  about the requested action.  The action itself takes place in the master,
 *  using threads named for the source client and the particular action, e.g.,
 *  Dynamic Client VM Stopper.

  /**
   *  IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   *  <p>
   *  A client action produces three RMI calls.  The first does the reservation
   *  and collects the target ClientVmInfo and any exceptions related to
   *  matching or test termination.  The second initiates the actual stop or
   *  start.  The third is a notification to synchronous clients that the action
   *  is complete (asynchronous clients need no notification).
   *  <p>
   *  The reason for this is to support asynchronous methods that allow the
   *  client to be doing real work when it is stopped.  Using a single RMI call
   *  from client to master forces the client side to do a join in order to get
   *  hold of ClientVmNotFoundException.  Using a single RMI call to initiate
   *  the action keeps the RMI connection open for a potentially long time.
   *  <p>
   *  Threads are used on both the client and master sides.  A thread is needed
   *  client-side to allow asynchronous clients to be doing real work when the
   *  action takes place.  Without the thread, the master can go forward with
   *  the action before the RMI call that initiates it returns to the client.
   *  A thread is needed master-side to implement asynchronous methods.
