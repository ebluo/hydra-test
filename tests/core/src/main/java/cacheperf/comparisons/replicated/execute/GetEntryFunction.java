/**
 * A function to mimic the behavior of a simple get() on a PartitionedRegion.  Use of this function
 * assures that get() operations always occur on the Primary node for the given key, and addresses
 * two issues:
 * <p>
 * <li> Work-around for PR Expiration limitation, whereby get() operations that occur on a secondary copy
 * of an Entry do not reset the Expiration Timer TTL.
 * <p>
 * <li> Work-around for PR Expiration problem discovered during SWA Session Caching application testing.
 * The problem discovered does not happen when get operations always occur on the Primary node for
 * the target key.
 * <p>
 * To register this function declaratively in a GFE peer, server, or client process, add the following to the
 * cache.xml file:
 * <p>
    "
    <function-service>
	    <function>"com.swacorp.session.poc.gemfire.GetEntryFunction"</function>
    </function-service>
    "
 * <p>
 * On the Java client, the function should be invoked by the String methodId, rather than by passing-in an actual instance of the function
 * (this would cause the function itself to be serialized and sent to the invocation target, which is only useful for dynamically created
 * functions or functions not previously registered on the server).
